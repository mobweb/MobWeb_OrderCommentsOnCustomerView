# MobWeb_OrderCommentsOnCustomerView extension for Magento

This Magento extension displays all order comments from all orders of a customer on their `Customer Information` page.

A new configuration option is added that allows to define filter strings, which will be used to filter the order comments. This allows the order comment overview to be set up to only display custom order comments, and exclude any default order comments (such as: "Refunded amount of..."). These filter strings can be added at `System -> Configuration -> Customers -> Customer Configuration -> Filter Comments By Strings`.

## Installation

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
